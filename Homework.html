<h1>Lesson 1: Homework</h1>  
<h2>A short introduction about myself</h2>

<p>My name is Hamda and I am 26 years of age. <br> I was born and raised in the Netherlands. <br> I moved to England at the age of 18 i.e. 8 years ago. <br> Hoyo woke up one day and decided that it was time to move to a new country, so here I am living and thriving in Birmingham. <br> I grew up on my bike in Holland and now I'm learning to ride a bike (again). <br> I used to have an extreme fear of flying and I have been avoiding travelling abroad until the age of 22. <br> I took a 'fear of flying course' which helped me overcome my fear and I am now  catching flights left right and centre.</p>
