                <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Beat together the butter and caster sugar until pale and creamy, then add the eggs, one at a time, slowly mixing through.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Sift in the self-raising flour, then add the lemon zest and mix until well combined.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Line a loaf tin (8 x 21cm) with greaseproof paper, then spoon in the mixture and level the top with a spoon.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Bake for 45-50 mins until a thin skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean.</li>
                <br>
                <li>While the cake is cooling in its tin, mix together the lemon juice and caster sugar to make the drizzle</li>
                <br>
                <li>Prick the warm cake all over with a skewer or fork, then pour over the drizzle. The juice will sink in and the sugar will form a lovely, crisp topping.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Leave in the tin until completely cool, then remove and serve.</li>
